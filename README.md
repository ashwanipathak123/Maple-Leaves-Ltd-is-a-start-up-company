# Maple-Leaves-Ltd-is-a-start-up-company
Maple Leaves Ltd is a start-up company which makes herbs from different types of plants  and its leaves. Currently the system they use to classify the trees which they import in a batch  is quite manual. A labourer from his experience decides the leaf type and subtype of plant  family. They have asked us to automate this process and remove any manual intervention  from this process
